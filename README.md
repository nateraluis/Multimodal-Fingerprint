This repository contains the code to replicate the algorithms and measures in the paper Natera, L.G., Battiston, F., IÃ±iguez, G., and Szell, M. *"Extracting the multimodal fingerprint of urban transportation networks"*, 2020.

## Guide
1. ```01_Multiplex.ipynb``` --> Takes the multilayer networks for the fifteen different cities and calculates their corresponding overlap census.

The data we used for the analysis is available at [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/GSOPCK).
